Sohyeon is a new graduate student at the Chang lab with a keen interest
in evolutionary developmental biology at the ecological scale. She
joined the Chang lab in 2023 to study modern molecular techniques for
analysis of gene regulation and genomes, as she firmly believes that
analyzing genetic materials in depth is essential to comprehending
the complexities of life.

In addition to her academic endeavors, Sohyeon enjoys training in a
variety of martial arts and is an avid kickboxer. Her diverse experiences
and perspectives have provided her with unique insights that she hopes
