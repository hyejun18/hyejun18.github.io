Ari Hong studies biochemistry and computational biology to develop
methods using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, especailly for decoding
new insights into translation and epitranscriptome.

#### Education

<ul class="chronological">
  <li><span>2022–present</span> Ph.D. student, Interdisciplinary Program in Bioinformatics, Seoul National University</li>
  <li><span>2020–2022</span> M.S. in Bioinformatics, Seoul National University</li>
  <li><span>2016–2020</span> B.S. in Food Science and Biotechnology, Seoul National University</li>
</ul>


#### Research Experience

<ul class="chronological">
  <li><span>2020–present</span> Graduate Student, Interdisciplinary
  Program in Bioinformatics, Seoul National University<br/>
  <blockquote>She is studying computational biology, especially about
  direct RNA sequencing or DRS, transcriptomics, and epigenetics. Under
  the guidance of Dr. Hyeshik Chang, she is developing new methodologies for
  DRS to decoding new insights into epigenome. Also, she is working on high
  throughput analysis for the mechanisms of translation.</blockquote></li>
  <li><span>2019–2020</span> Intern, Seoul National University<br/>
  <blockquote>As an undergraduate at the Seoul National University,
  she had internship in Dr. Chang's lab. She learned the basic methods
  to analyze high-throughput RNA sequencing data, including ribosome
  profiling, or CLIP-seq using data from <a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674%2812%2901234-2">LIN28A Is a Suppressor of ER-Associated Translation in Embryonic Stem Cells</a>
  for two months. In September 2019, she started a project to proceed with
  the Master's course and develop an analysis pipeline. She also learned
  experimental techniques such as cell culture, RNA extraction, <i>in vitro</i>
  transcription, and gel extraction.</blockquote></li>
  <li><span>2019–2019</span> Intern, Seoul National University<br/>
  <blockquote>She worked as undergraduate research student at Food Engineering
  Laboratory for two months. Under Dr. Youngjin Choi, she constructed system
  to detect target from food sample, such as allergen or food poisoning
  bacteria. Gold nanoparticle, silica nanoparticle, and aptamer were
  used to that system, and she optimized the their ratio to present shift
  of precipitation area according to target concentration.</blockquote></li>
<li><span>2017-2019</span> Undergraduate Research Assistant, <a href="http://calslab.snu.ac.kr/cfb/">Center for Food and Bioconvergence,</a> Seoul National University<br/>
  <blockquote>She worked as undergraduate research assistant at CFB
  or center for food and bio convergence located in Seoul National
  University. Under Dr. Yang Kim, she worked on preparing a sample for the
  paper (Yang et al, 2020).</blockquote>
